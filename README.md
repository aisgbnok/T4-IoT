# T4 - IoT

Welcome to Team 4's IoT classification assignment 4 from the CSEC 520/620 course during the 2221 semester.
The purpose of this assignment is to classify IoT devices based on their network traffic meta-data.

The [`T4-A3-IoT.ipynb`](T4-A3-IoT.ipynb) notebook contains the team code for this assignment.
The [`T4-A3-IoT-Anthony.py`](T4-A3-IoT-Anthony.py) file contains my partial rewrite of the assignment.
My code is not complete, but I believe it contains a better foundation for the assignment than what we went with as a team.
